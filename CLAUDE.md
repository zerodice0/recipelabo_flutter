## Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing folder structure when adding new features
- Implement new screens using the view/viewmodel pattern
- Create use cases for business logic rather than putting it in ViewModels
- Use entities in the domain layer and models in the data layer
- Keep ViewModels focused on UI state management
- Use Freezed for all data classes and state objects
- Implement proper error handling in all async operations
- Follow the established naming conventions for files and classes

## Project Overview

### 1. Project Goals
The objective of this project is to develop a personalized mobile application that allows users to systematically create, evolve, and manage their own sauce recipes. The core goals are as follows:

Personalized Recipe Asset Management: To enable users to meticulously record their unique sauce recipes down to the precise ingredient and quantity, allowing them to build and permanently store a digital library of personal recipe assets.
Evolutionary Recipe Development: To facilitate the gradual evolution of recipes. Through a "Recipe Versioning" and "Cooking Log" system, users can fork new versions from existing recipes based on their real-world cooking experiences (e.g., "a bit too salty," "use less sugar next time"), rather than overwriting them. This preserves the entire developmental history of a recipe.
Frictionless User Experience: To provide a frictionless user experience. The app will feature "In-Context Ingredient Creation," allowing users to add new ingredients without disrupting their recipe creation workflow. A "Tag/Chip-Based Input" system will prevent typos and ensure data consistency, allowing users to focus solely on the task of recording their recipes.
Data-Driven Discovery: To enable data-driven meal discovery. Users can instantly search for recipes they can make with the ingredients they currently have, effectively answering the question, "What can I cook today?"
Robust & Scalable Architecture: To build a robust and scalable architecture. The project will initially adopt a "Local-First" approach, ensuring full offline functionality and fast performance. By implementing Clean Architecture, the app will be flexible and prepared for future expansion, such as introducing server-side data synchronization and sharing features.

### 2. Screens to Implement
To achieve the goals above, the following screens will be implemented.

#### 1. Splash Screen
Key Features: Display app logo on launch, check user authentication status, and automatically redirect to either the Main Screen or Login Screen.

#### 2. Authentication Screens
Key Features: Provide login and sign-up functionality using email/password authentication.

#### 3. Main Screen (Recipe Group List)
Key Features: Display a list of all user-created "Recipe Groups" in a card format (note: shows groups, not individual versions). Provide a guided "Empty State" UI for new users. Serve as the entry point for the ingredient-based search.

#### 4. Recipe Detail Screen
Key Features: Allow users to browse and select from all available versions within a specific "Recipe Group" (e.g., v1-Original, v2-Less Spicy). Display the detailed ingredient list for the selected version. Show a chronological list of all "Cooking Logs" (photos, memos) associated with that specific version.

#### 5. Recipe Create/Edit Screen
Key Features:
- Create new recipe groups and their initial versions.
- Modify an existing version and choose to either "Overwrite" it or "Save as a New Version."
- Add ingredients from a predefined list (tags/chips) and adjust quantities in "1/4 tablespoon" increments.
- Provide "In-Context Ingredient Creation" to add new, unlisted ingredients on the fly.

#### 6. Cooking Log Create Screen
Key Features: After cooking with a specific recipe version, allow the user to record and save a photo of the dish along with a dedicated memo (e.g., "Turned out great," "Add more vegetables next time").

#### 7. Ingredient-based Search Screen
Key Features: Display a comprehensive list of all ingredients as selectable chips. As the user selects chips, the list of recipe groups is filtered in real-time to show only those containing all the selected ingredients.

#### 8. Profile/Settings Screen
Key Features: Provide user logout and account management. Include an "Ingredient List Management" feature for users to merge, delete, or correct any duplicate or misspelled ingredients that may result from the "In-Context Ingredient Creation" feature.
